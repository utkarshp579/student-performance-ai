model.py -->	ML model training script (runs once)
app.py	--> Likely a Flask/Streamlit app serving the UI + logic
dataset.csv   --> 	Data storage
student_model.pkl 	Serialized trained model

venv/             -->   Virtual environment (isolated Python packages)
requirements.txt  -->   List of dependencies (pip freeze > requirements.txt)

## Common Commands:
.\.venv\Scripts\activate          --> Activate venv (always do this first!)

pip install -r requirements.txt   --> Install all dependencies
pip list                          --> Check installed packages


1️⃣	requirements.txt	Know what libraries are used
2️⃣	dataset.csv	Understand the data structure
3️⃣	model.py	See how ML model is trained
4️⃣	app.py	See how the app uses the model
